# Pong Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic **Pong** game using the **Turtle** graphics library. It's a two-player game where each player controls a paddle, and the objective is to prevent the ball from passing their paddle to score points.

## Game Description

In this game, two paddles (left and right) move vertically to hit the ball back and forth. The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls, as well as the paddles. If a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point. The game continues until one player decides to quit.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: One player controls the left paddle using "W" and "S", while the other controls the right paddle using the arrow keys (Up and Down).
- **Score tracking**: The game keeps track of the score for both players and displays it on the screen.
- **Realistic ball movement**: The ball speeds up slightly each time it bounces off a paddle.
- **Wall collision detection**: The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls, adding a challenge for the players.
